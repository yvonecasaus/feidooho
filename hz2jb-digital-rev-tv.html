                            <p> I dont understand, why they are so successful!? In my Opinion, this channel is completely chaotic, they are not funny at all and, most important, not helpful. What am I missing? It is just me? I can't explain the one and a half million Subscribers. I'd love to have an AMA from Kai Wong. For those who don't know he's the main reviewer on Digital Rev TV, Youtube's biggest photography channel. 1. For a fake accent yours is pretty remarkable. Have you been to the UK at all? Do you think English is in decline in Hong Kong? 2. How big is the Hong Kong photography scene? 3. What are your thoughts on the increasing number of mainland chinese in Hong Kong? 4. What's your favourite general purpose canon lens? 5. What are some of your favourit. Hey /r/photography Question is pretty straight forward. Which gear reviewers (youtube or otherwise) are your favorites and why? For me: Chris and Jordan (Former CameraStoreTV, now DPReview). By far what I consider the most complete, honest, and informative reviews. If you're looking for someone to give you the facts, whether you are a beginner or a pro, along with their personal opinion in the end, you can't go wrong with them. Kai (Kaiman Wong, Former DigitalRevTV): Honestly # These Toys Are Spying On You (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkA9-l_lSU0ampindex=23) - Chadtronic - Dec 23, 2017 Note: A lot of these ads are rare and the ones after the dashed lines are even more rare. There are mirrors of videos, the closer to first place on the list, the better the quality/ the more recommended their use. There are also some stray ads that are after a dashed line (these are a cariation, a one and only variation). Note 2: As funny as it may be to talk about. I got my first "real" camera this Christmas, a Canon T3, and picked up a 50mm 1.8. I really like the idea of street photography and after doing a lot of research I stumbled upon some "day in the life" videos of photojournalists and it sparked my interest. I really like being around new people and new environments, and I'm not super into shooting stuff like landscapes or art, I like shooting people, buildings, events, and cars. Photojournalism looks awesome, and I could see myself doing anything. Hey guys! I'm new to photography and to Reddit so bear with me. I've always liked taking pictures, but only a few months ago did I buy a real camera, the Canon EOS 760D. My pictures are trash, so I'd like to know how I can improve. I try to take a lot of pictures to gain experience, but I often have trouble finding interesting shots. Maybe I am not creative enough. I am about to finish a NatGeo book on Landscape photography. I watch a lot of youtubers such as DigitalRev 
I already watch Matt Day, Ted Forbes, EduardoPavezGoye, the Analog Series, Tim Huebeck and Praemio. Trying to find more sources of knowledge and inspiration! Thanks! EDIT: Add KEHCamera to that list as well. And Obviously DigitalRev. Read my interview with Alamby Leung, "that girl" formerly with DigitalREV TV. You'll find it on Shutterbug's homepage. http://www.shutterbug.com/content/interview-alamby-leung-%E2%80%9C-girl%E2%80%9D-formerly-digitalrev-tv#UjCd3suqorXoECjV.97. Here are the videos featuring all the captured footage from those who were granted early access to the Mavic. Some of the footage looks fantastic, while the others look way too soft and blurry. I've compiled them in this post. Great Footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlEMSTlvIjsampfeature=youtu.be iJustine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBb4SHTpduM Jon Olsson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i9Uo_szlqU Not so great footage: Casey Neistat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw4jD. I've always been one for immersing myself in some sort of new knowledge, and I've gone through many, many phases, or hobbies. A few recommendations; - Lockpicking : seems to be a popular recommendation around here. Fantastic hobby, I recommend watching some videos by BosnianBill on YouTube, get some picks (or better, make your own) and constantly improve. I pick locks every day and it's quite fun. /r/lockpicking - Poker - I've never gambled online So I'm wondering why people keep answering this question, so here it is, photogs of reddit: I have gone back and collected as many quality threads/links as I could. This is only a sample of the posts I found, and there are probably way more good ones out there. If you know of any good ones that I missed, comment with them below. OVERALL Basic Canon vs. Nikon poll ( Nikon or Canon (http. I was about to buy the D5500 as my first DSLR. I also wanted to get a prime lens. I watched multiple videos, read about them and was about to get the 50mm 1.8G Then I heard that the lenses interact in a different way with smaller sensors (which the D5500 has with its DX format). DigitalRev TV said that 35mm lenses behave like 50mm ones on DX sensors. All fine. Now I found out that there is also a DX version of the 35mm (not of the 50mm though). What's the difference this time? Finally This will be my traveling gear (and I hate tripods, I like flash though). I'll be shooting some commercial stuff, mostly for product promotions for web and magazine (so sensor size should be a non-issue, or, as some would say, it's the viewing distance of your work). I used to shoot film, and I have no problem with crappy auto-focus, though it is appreciated. (If it's any indicator, my favorite set is the Mamiya RB67 proSD with Kodak E100.) I mostly shoot indoor stills. Everyone knows DigitalRevTV (whether you love them or hate them) but who are your other favorite photography youtubers? I am a gearhead myself so I love watching videos about different cameras and lenses. Personally, I find TheCameraStoreTV to be mildly entertaining as well as informational.

He said he didn't know anything about releasing an album and asked about DistroKid (which I release through). I then went on to write him a long email filled with multiple things he should be doing, from selecting a PRO to setting up social media accounts. I realized that in learning this myself, it took some time to research, but being self-taught and learning by googling. # MAME 0.207 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=466) It’s almost the end of February, and more importantly it’s time for MAME 0.207 to be released! We’ve added two Nintendo Game amp Watch titles this month: Fire (wide screen) and Snoopy Tennis.

So there's these posts that are becoming popular around Reddit "You have an unlimited budget and can revive any property you want for a movie or tv series, what do you choose?" - well I choose Knight Rider. But I'd do it in a way that tries to avoid the mistakes of KR 2008 while still giving it a modern edge and current topical relevance.
