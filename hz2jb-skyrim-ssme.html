Skyrim has been out for over two years now, and throughout that time we have had many INI tweaks revealed over time. Unfortunately, too many have been posted #232 無限ロード対策にはこれとssme若しくはskseのメモリ機能の"両方"を導入しないと"全く"と言っていいほど"効果ない"ですよ. 
개인적으로 ssme의 DefaultHeapInitialAllocMB= 840mb, x64=false 보단 차라리 DefaultHeapInitialAllocMB=768m b, x64=true가 더 활용성이 좋아보인다. I tried to open my CK and it won't open. It starts in task manager for around 0.1 second (literally) and closes. I THINK it was after I installed the skyrim SSME patch. I tried removing the SSME dll and it didn't change anything at all. One odd thing is that, I copied the CK.exe (and only the CK.exe) to another folder completely on another drive, tried starting it up and apparently the ENB is still stuck to it and it tried to create some enb related files. edit: copied, not move. Rimworld 部屋の広さ (03/27) Skyrim MOD紹介 最初にいれておきたいお勧めMOD編 (08/25) Skyrim skyrim.ini skyrimprefs.ini 設定 (08/25). Looking for some help with mod issues. About two years ago, I played through Skyrim with a mod list identical to this one, although without all of the DLC. It worked flawlessly, but recently I've decided to do another playthrough after picking up all DLC, so I tried reinstalling this mod list to no avail. I get crashes and freezing while walking around Skyrim. I was able to play through the entire intro sequence with this mod list, but the crashes began when I started heading towards Riverwood. 最近PCトラブルでSkyrim再インストールしましたが、 メモリ管理はENBにまかせる時代ですね。 別プロセス（enbhost.exe）のメモリ空間を利用してSkyrim側がメモリ空間を食いつぶさないようにする、. I'm a bit overwhelmed. Is there any MODERN guide for which "optimizer" mods to install for original skyrim (not SE)? It seems that there are a TON of "optimizer" mods, but a lot of them are outdated and may or may not have been merged into other mods/fixes (possibly even merged into USLEEP.) I'm just. annoyed. Skyrim was released 7 years ago and when playing it (albeit with. close to 100 mods) my FPS drops to below 60 with a 1060 when in towns or around

Skyrim INI Manager v1.6. Skyrim INI Manager（イニマネ）のメジャーアップデートです！ あ、以前に開発終了宣言をしましたがあれは嘘です、イニマネはこれからも開発を続けますよ(´ー`). To all the people pointing out that SKSE is easy to install, I use Linux for most of my PC usage as well as gaming. I run the Windows version of steam through wine with playonlinux. It's already hard enough to get the game running properly without the complication of SKSE. I have tried Skyrim with SKSE in wine but skyUI doesn't recognize it running though I did launch it through the SKSE launcher as well as an horrible drop in FPS where I already didn't have much to spare. Skyrim INI Manager v1.7 正式版をNexusに公開しました。 今から三年ほど前に開発を始めて今に至りますが恐らくこれで最終バージョンになると思います。. I apologize in advance for posting this here since it's not related to Requiem but I know some users here are experienced modders and would really like illuminated opinions. I'm currently running Enhanced Blood Textures + Burn Freeze Shock Effects + Wet amp Cold + Frostfall + Violence + Ultimate Combat + Deadly Dragons + Civil War Overhaul and I'm just a bit worried about script overload related CTDs. I'm generally not crashing in the first few hours of the game but at around level 15-20. このModはアクション性の向上と遊びやすさに重点を置いた戦闘のオーバーホールModです。難度を上げるよりもスカイリムをきちんとしたアクションゲームに近づけるのが目的です。. 
This guy has saved me DAYS of effort by compiling a list of graphic mods!

My new play-through I'm planning on using SPERG, Dual Combat Realism, and Skyrim Unleashed. Anything you guys think I should add would be appreciated, thanks. 
Installation seemed simple enough, "Place d3dx9_42.dll and ssme.ini in your Skyrim folder (not the Data subfolder)." The mod description says "If it loads, it will create ssme.log in your Skyrim folder." So far I have not seen any evidence of this anywhere. I'm not sure what to do, I was looking forward to the benefits of this and the Winterhold mods I want to download are dependent on this. here is what the SSME file has in it.

I had some crashes so i decided to use ssme and for some reason it is making my game crash always when i go to a loading screen.

Skyrim Stability Guide mentions one setting that can remove the stuttering but it warns against using it because it increases VRAM usage which means CTDs will occur much more often. I finally have all the mods I want to start playing skyrim but the stutters are pretty annoying. Two other problems I found also which would be nice if there's a solution for them. When I ult tab and try to go back to game, the game becomes unresponsive and I have to force quit the game. The second problem So guys I've almost took all the walls down with my head, this problem is a mess. Speaking of a mess this whole game is a mess, turns out it's beautiful enough for me to want to deal with it. So I learned about the skyrim performance monitor and I decided to figure out what causes my crashes. Found out it goes to about 2.6gb of ram, then it magically instantly falls down to 1.2, after that it reaches around 1.8 and the game is frozen. Audio is still going, I'm finding myself stopping the process. I see a lot of posts on here about people getting random ctds, and most of the time it is because they don't have the memory patch. Get it here (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50305/?). In addition to the CTDs and long load times I have horrible stuttering issues but I am not sure if that is just because of my AMD cpu. I will be running at a stable 60 fps but If I look around it can drop immediately to the 40s before coming back up. I have the latest version of Skyrim, Dragonborn, and Hearthsfire, use NMM, have the latest SKSE installed, and sort my mods with the latest version of LOOT. Have cleaned masters with tes5 edit. I have ENB series installed for the use of ENBbo. I did the following: Remove certain mods and Load a savegame, see if it works Still CTD I runned FNIS again and disabled landscape related Mods Still CTD I ran Loot again and checked for Errors or Warnings, nothing showed up still CTD My savegame is not missing Scripts or Mods, i doublechecked with Skyrim Save Game Cleaner, all scripts are in place, no orphan scripts. I checked the Mods with same tool AND MO and no mods are missing(except when i removed some for testing) So i have 2 Problems. I read some where that if I used SSME / memory patch that if I use too many mods / texture packs etc that it could fry my hardware. I'm not using insanely taxing texture packs or anything for my hardware (infact I'm only using some basic packs to make towns look more colorful). Load order if anyone is curious: Edit: I watched Gophers video on it and I think It'll be fine as long as I don't 
So, I really fucked my Skyrim up. I'm not sure if it's because of all the ~~dank ass~~ texture mods I've installed, or just mods I have that conflict with eachother secretly, or what. edit: Also worth mentioning I'm using Mod Organizer, if I hadn't already #The Story I was able to play in my current save for about 28 hours with little-to-no crashing (I think I crashed 2 times total before it became a serious problem). But, 28 hours into the game, I come strolling out of Whiterun, decked Hey there guys and gals, Ive been running Skyrim with my new PC build and loving it. But I'm getting a lot of random crashes lately. I'm not sure what's causing the problem and I hope some of you could help out. I'm using BOSS and run it after every mod i download and install, I've cleaned the DLC's and main game with TES5edit. I've heard there was a new mods that came out a few days ago that fixes alot of the CTD's. If anyone can link me, that would be great. Here's my plugin Credits and distribution permission.
